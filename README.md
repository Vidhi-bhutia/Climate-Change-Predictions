## 🌍 Climate Change Model Comparison: Optimized Machine Learning for Temperature Predictions
Welcome to my latest project where I explore and compare machine learning models to predict global temperatures using a rich dataset of climate change factors.

#### 🚀 Project Overview
In this repository, I’ve developed a Streamlit web app that demonstrates the power of different machine learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to predict temperature changes based on various environmental factors. The project focuses on optimizing these models and visualizing their performance, aiming to bring meaningful insights into how various climate variables impact temperature predictions.

#### 🎯 Why I Built This
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues we face today. With this project, I wanted to dive deeper into how we can leverage machine learning to model and predict temperature shifts and support research efforts aimed at tackling environmental challenges. This project is a culmination of my passion for data, sustainability, and machine learning.
